  // FAQ page
  "faq.title": "FAQ",
  "faq.q1": "The damage doesn't match the actual game",
  "faq.a1": "This tool is in beta, and some champion-specific effects or special item effects may not yet be implemented. Values may also have changed due to patch updates. If you find any errors, please report them via the contact page. We continuously improve through updates.",
  "faq.q2": "When is the data updated?",
  "faq.a2": "Champion and item data is sourced from Riot Games' Data Dragon API. When a new patch is released, data is automatically updated in line with Data Dragon updates. However, detailed skill calculation formulas are updated manually, so there may be a delay.",
  "faq.q3": "Can I use it on mobile?",
  "faq.a3": "Yes, the site has a responsive design. On smartphones, you can switch between Blue/VS/Red tabs. However, due to screen size limitations, we recommend using it on PC for the best experience.",
  "faq.q4": "Can I save and share builds?",
  "faq.a4": "Yes, you can generate and share URLs from the builds page. Additionally, simulator settings are automatically saved to your browser's local storage, so your configuration persists across page reloads.",
  "faq.q5": "Are there any unsupported champions or items?",
  "faq.a5": "Generally all champions and completed items are supported, but some champion-specific mechanics (transformations, pet control, etc.) may be simplified. New and reworked champions will be supported after data updates.",
  "faq.q6": "Are all rune effects reflected?",
  "faq.a6": "Major rune stat effects are reflected, but some conditional effects (runes that activate under specific circumstances) can be manually entered through the bonus stats panel to include in calculations.",
  "faq.q7": "How do I report bugs or feature requests?",
  "faq.a7": "Please contact us at the email address listed on the contact page. For bugs, including the champion, items, level, and details of the issue will help us respond quickly.",
